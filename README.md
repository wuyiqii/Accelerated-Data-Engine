# To establish a new dataset quickly:
### Step 1:
Run R&G models for getting auto-annotators.
➡️ ./R&G models/
### Step 2:
Refines the auto-annotated data through a selection process.
➡️ ./selectors/
### Step 3:
Manual correction
### Our datasets developing by ADE workflow👍
➡️ ./datasets/
❗️The overall procedures and manual work for developing datasets from complex and intense livestock scenarios were significantly reduced by the ADE workflow.
